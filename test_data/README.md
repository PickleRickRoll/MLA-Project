# Dataset Folder

This folder is intended to store your raw data files, including `.wav` and `.mid` files. If you need to change the default path for your data, please edit the `variables.py` script located in the `scripts` directory.

For your convenience, some sample sounds and test tracks are provided to help you get started quickly and for testing purposes.
